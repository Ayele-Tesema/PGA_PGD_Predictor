# Optimized Machine Learning Tool for Efficient PGA and PGD Predictions

Welcome to the Optimized Machine Learning Tool for Efficient PGA and PGD Predictions repository! This tool is designed to provide a rapid and accurate accurate prediction of peak ground acceleration and displacement (PGA & PGD).

## Getting Started!

### Installation

To get started with prediction tool, you need to have Python and required libraries installed on your system.


### Running the Application!

To successfully run the tool, please follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**

     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn PySimpleGUI 
     ```

3. **Download the Application Script**
   - Download the `PGA_PGD_OptML.py` script to your local machine.

4. **Open Your Python Environment**
   - Launch your preferred Python environment (for instance, Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code).

5. **Load the Script**
   - In your Python environment, open the `PGA_PGD_OptML.py`  script.

6. **Run the Application**
   - Execute the script to start the application. This is typically done by pressing a 'Run' button in IDEs or using a run command in the console.

Following these instructions will enable you to run the PGA_PGD_OptML.py application in any compatible Python environment.
